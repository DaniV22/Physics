### Physics

Some of the most common physics problems solved computationally, using Python. Each problem is presented in a Jupyter Notebook file,
where there is a brief introduction to the problem and how the problem can be approached in order to solve it numerically.

At the moment, there are the following problems:

* **Electromagnetism:** You can find how to compute the magnetic field for different wire curves, using the Biot-Savart Law. 

* **Fractals:** A brief introduction to fractals and how to obtain some of the most common fractals figures. On another Jupyter Notebook file,
                you can find an explanation of random walks and how they are related to diffusion.
                
* **Gravity:** A bunch of Jupyter Notebook files where the 2-body problem and (restricted) 3-body problem are solved numerically. There's an extra file
               where the Hohmann Transfer Orbit are explained and computed.
               
* **Ising Model:** The famous Ising Model for a square lattice is solved and some physical magnitudes are computed.

* **Oscillatory Motion:** A general overview of the oscillatory motion, from simple pendulum to driven pendulum, and a brief introduction to chaos theory.
